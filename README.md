# Google App Rating Prediction
The aim of this project is to generally visualize the distribution of the dataset across categories, identify correlations among the parameters and to use machine learning model which could predict user ratings on app. Seaborn & Matplotlib libraries of python were used to perform visualizations on python. Multiple Linear Regression model was trained on the available data. Important parameters responsible for predicting the ratings were identified.
